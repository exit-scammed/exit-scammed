I quitted Minecraft (including making bypasses), please don't ask me for any other project related to it. Thanks. \
(For those who use LiquidBounce+, I will still respond and fix/improve the code if possible, but I will never cheat/play MC again. And if I do, I will just code the visuals.) 

Don't worry I'm still active on Discord and osu!.
